    <h1>Text Formatting</h1>
    <p>There are three main types of text formatting. Those are <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, and <u>underline</u>.</p>

    <h2>Inline vs. Block Elements</h2>
    <p>A <b>block element</b> moves the content to a new line. The paragraph and header elements are block elements. An <b>inline element</b> does not display its content on a new line. it keeps the content on the same line as the previous content. Bold, italics, and underline are all inline elements. </p>

    <h3>Block Elements Examples</h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p><p>This is a paragraph on the same line in the code as the previous paragraph, but it still moves to the next line.</p>
    <p>This is an example of a nested block element. <p>This is the nested block</p></p>

    <h3><u>Inline Elements Examples</u></h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph with <b>an inline element</b>. Notice how the inline element does not move to a new line.</p>

    <h2>Vertical Text Spacing</h2>
    <p>There are two elements that help with vertical spacing between block elements. A <b>line break</b> element adds an empty line an moves the content down to a new line. its similar to the <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key in a Google/Word doc. A <b>Horizontal rule</b> is a line break with a horizontal bar across the page. Both of these are block elements</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph there is a line break </p>
    <br>
    <p>Above this paragraph is a line break</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph is a horizontal rule.</p>

    <h1>Attributes</h1>
    <p><b>Attributes</b> are properties which can change an HTML element. Attributes are written in the opening tag of ANY html element. The most common attributes are <i>src</i>, <i>href</i>, <i>class</i>, <i>id</i>, and <i>style</i>.</p>

    <h2>Inline CSS Styles</h2>
    <p>The <i>styles</i> attribute allows you to add css style to any HTML element.</p>

    <p style="color: orangered"> This paragraph has inline css style which chages the font color to red.</p>


    <p style = "background-color: slategray"> This paragraph has inline css style which changes the background color.</p>

    <p style = "color: yellow; background-color: black "> This paragraph has inline css which changes the font color <b>AND</b> background color.</p>

    <p style="font-family: Haettenschweiler ">This paragraph has a different font type.</p>

    <p style="background-color: #2a3d66; color: #9d65c9; font-family: 'Edwardian Script ITC'; font-size: 70px  "> This paragraph has all 4 inline styles.</p>
