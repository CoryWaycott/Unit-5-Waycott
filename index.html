    <h1>Headers</h1>
    <p>Headers are used to create titles and section titles. there are 6 different sizes pre-formatted for HTML.</p>
    <h1>h1 - Computer Science</h1>
    <h2>h2 - Computer Science</h2>
    <h3>h3 - Computer Science</h3>
    <h4>h4 - Computer Science</h4>

    <h1>Text Formatting</h1>
    <p>There are three main types of text formatting. Those are <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, and <u>underline</u>.</p>

    <h2>Inline vs. Block Elements</h2>
    <p>A <b>block element</b> moves the content to a new line. The paragraph and header elements are block elements. An <b>inline element</b> does not display its content on a new line. it keeps the content on the same line as the previous content. Bold, italics, and underline are all inline elements. </p>

    <h3>Block Elements Examples</h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p><p>This is a paragraph on the same line in the code as the previous paragraph, but it still moves to the next line.</p>
    <p>This is an example of a nested block element. <p>This is the nested block</p></p>

    <h3><u>Inline Elements Examples</u></h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph with <b>an inline element</b>. Notice how the inline element does not move to a new line.</p>

    <h2>Vertical Text Spacing</h2>
    <p>There are two elements that help with vertical spacing between block elements. A <b>line break</b> element adds an empty line an moves the content down to a new line. its similar to the <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key in a Google/Word doc. A <b>Horizontal rule</b> is a line break with a horizontal bar across the page. Both of these are block elements</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph there is a line break </p>
    <br>
    <p>Above this paragraph is a line break</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph is a horizontal rule.</p>

    <h1>Attributes</h1>
    <p><b>Attributes</b> are properties which can change an HTML element. Attributes are written in the opening tag of ANY html element. The most common attributes are <i>src</i>, <i>href</i>, <i>class</i>, <i>id</i>, and <i>style</i>.</p>

    <h2>Inline CSS Styles</h2>
    <p>The <i>styles</i> attribute allows you to add css style to any HTML element.</p>

    <p style="color: orangered"> This paragraph has inline css style which chages the font color to red.</p>


    <p style = "background-color: slategray"> This paragraph has inline css style which changes the background color.</p>

    <p style = "color: yellow; background-color: black "> This paragraph has inline css which changes the font color <b>AND</b> background color.</p>

    <p style="font-family: Haettenschweiler ">This paragraph has a different font type.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 50px"> This paragraph has a larger font size.</p>

    <p style="background-color: #2a3d66; color: #9d65c9; font-family: 'Edwardian Script ITC'; font-size: 70px  "> This paragraph has all 4 inline styles.</p>

    <h1>Images</h1>
    <p>An <b>image element</b> is an <i>inline</i> element which inserts pictures into the document. An image element is self-closing, which means it does not have a closing tag. it has one major attribute, src, which is a filepath that points to the images' location. Those filepaths can either be <b>absolute</b> or <b>relative</b>.</p>

    <h2>Simple Image Example</h2>
    <img src="https://www.nature.com/news/polopoly_fs/7.15967.1394212667!/image/Wolf.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_630/Wolf.jpg">

    <h2>Image Attributes</h2>
    <P>There are 4 attributes commonly used for images. <I>width</I> and <i>height</i> are used to resize the images. <i>alt</i> allows to use text description of images for accessibility and broken images. <i>title</i> allows a hover-over text to appear.</P>

    <h3>Width and Height</h3>
    <p>The width and height can be measured in many different ways, but the more common ones are pixels and percentages. Using pixels, you set the specific size based on pixels. using percentages, you set the dimensions based on a percentage of the entire page. In either case setting the width alone respects aspect ration, while setting both does not.</p>

    <h3>Alt Attribute</h3>

    <p>EVERY picture should at least have the alt attribute. The alt attribute helps with screen readers for visually impaired and in the cases that the image is broken.</p>

    <img src="https://www.nature.com/news/polopoly_fs/7.15967.1394212667!/image/Wolf.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_630/Wolf.jg" alt="Wolf standing in forest" width="150px">

    <h2>Relative vs. Absolute</h2>
    <p>An <b>absolute</b> filepath includes all the navigation to get to the server, folder and file. The examples above are all absolute filepaths. An absolute file path is used when the image is stored on a different server or device than the HTML document.</p>

    <p> A <b>relative</b> filepath only includes folders and files. The example below is a relative filepath. A relative filepath is used when the images are stored alongside the HTML document.</p>

    <img src="coyote.jpg" width="150px" alt="Crazy coyote staring at you">

    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>The <b>anchor element</b> is an <i>inline element</i> and is a way to include hypertext links, otherwise known as just links, in your document. An anchor is a reference point for other documents or files. It commonly has 3 attributes: <i>href</i>, <i>target</i>, and <i>download</i>.</p>

    <h2>A Simple Link</h2>
    <a href="https://ihasabucket.com/">Link</a>

    <p>In order for the link to work, it <b>MUSt</b> include the <i>href</i> attribute. This attribute is the filepath, either absolute or relative, to the document, website or file you wish to link.</p>

    <h2>Link Attributes</h2>
    <p>the <i>target</i> attribute allows you to decide where the link opens. there are 4 options, but we will only discuss two in this course. <i>_blank</i> opens the linked document in a new tab. <i>_self</i> opens the document in the current window or tab. This is the default behavior.</p>

    <a href="https://ihasabucket.com/" target="_blank">This link opens up a new tab.</a>

    <p>The <i>download</i> attribute allows you to download the file or document linked and assign it to a new filename. This is commonly used only with relative filepaths. </p>

    <a href="coyote.jpg" download="CoyotePic">This will download a coyote picture</a>

    <h2>A Picture as a Link</h2>
    <p>Since a link has an opening AND closing tag, we can place ANY HTML ELEMENT as its content, which includes pictures, we simply nest the image element inside the anchor element. </p>

    <a href="https://ihasabucket.com/" target="_blank">
        <img src="coyote.jpg" width="150px" alt="Crazy coyote staring at you">
    </a>

    <h2>Link to Another Page</h2>
